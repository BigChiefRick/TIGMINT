"we would be standing in qs to prove our identity as well. and my dear hindus if in anycase you would not be able to prove your citizenship, do not stay happy as you will be given SECOND grade citizen.

you will become a minority in your own state. in your own land !!"
"we will also be providing food and shelter to the detained for several months and no other country will be ready to accept them coz they are already full of people (afghanistan,pakistan,bangladesh)

this will lead to massive disruption in the lives of these people as well as ours"
"70,000 crore may lead to detention of around 2 crore people at max ! that will be 35000 rupees per person detained. 

at the same time we will also be allowing several people indian citizenship. maybe 50 lakh

that drops the effective detainees to 1.5 crore."
"1600 crore spent for 5 lakh detained. that is 32000 per detained person.(assam figures declared by the government)

also 1600 crore for 3 crore people of assam

doing the maths for indian scenario
that is 533 crore rupees per 1 crore people

for 130 crore people 
130*533=70,000"
